		of playing them, using typical or sometimes not so typical devices. Many splendid openings had
to be left out, and this is not down to my opinion of them but merely to the shortage of space.
Now, about the games: selecting them was not a simple task, considering that so many works
on tactics and aggression were on the chess book market and that I was categorically opposed
to repeating other people’s analyses. It is for this latter reason, and not at all out of unbridled
narcissism, that I have included many games of my own. But that is not all. For several years
now, inspired by Garry Kasparov’s immensely interesting work My Great Predecessors, I have been
diligently studying the games of the great former generation that included Mikhail Tal, Boris
Spassky, Leonid Stein, Viktor Korchnoi, Tigran Petrosian and many another illustrious names.
It frankly amazed me to ascertain how many games from that era, which is not so very distant,
had remained practically uninvestigated. It seemed to me quite a senseless idea to analyse the
brilliant victories of Kasparov, Anand or Topalov for the thousandth time; in a country like
India, for instance, where I have spent a fair amount of time coaching with delight and gratitude,
these games are known in every nursery school! It therefore seemed entirely reasonable to focus
primarily on games played by the giants of that earlier generation. Many of the games, naturally,
are wins by Mikhail Tal, and this of course is not surprising. Few players have conducted as
many brilliant attacks as the Hussar from Riga. Some games will strike you as familiar – this was
impossible to avoid – but all of them are supplied with some fundamentally new analysis, allowing
you to look at them from an entirely new angle.
